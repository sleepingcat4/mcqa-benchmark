The given values ($k$ and $x$) suggest we're working with a linear relationship between $x$ and $k$, but not directly on the same side of the variable. We must isolate $x$ as much as possible before applying algebraic manipulations.\\n\\nI'll explain:\\n\\n1. Start with the original equation in its simplified form.\\n2. Apply arithmetic operations to move all terms involving $x$ to one side.\\n3. Simplify the resulting expression to isolate $x$.\\n4. Solve for $x$ manually or use algebraic techniques if necessary.\\n\\nThis method avoids using numerical calculations and provides a clear understanding of how variables behave under different forms of manipulation. So, let's apply these principles:\\n\\na) First, I'll simplify $k$:\\n$$\\\\frac{x - 1}{3} = k$$\\n\\nb) Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:\\n$$\\\\frac{1}{3}\\\\left(x - 1\\\\right)=3$$\\n\\nc) Distribute the 3:\\n$$\\\\frac{1}{3}\\\\cdot x-\\\\frac{1}{3}\\\\cdot 1=\\\\frac{3}{3}$$\\n\\nd) Combine like terms:\\n$$\\\\frac{1}{3}\\\\cdot x-\\\\frac{3}{3}+\\\\frac{3}{3}=0$$\\n\\ne) Factor out $\\\\frac{1}{3}$:\\n$$\\\\frac{1}{3}\\\\left(1-x\\\\right)=0$$\\n\\nf) Divide by $\\\\frac{1}{3}$:\\n$$1-x=0$$\\n\\ng) Add $x$ to both sides:\\n$$x=-1$$\\n\\nHowever, note that this doesn't represent the full solution because $x$ isn't isolated yet. To find $x$, we need to manipulate our work further. Let's go back to step 4:\\n\\nh) Rearrange:\\n$$x+(-1)=0$$\\n\\ni) Move positive signs to left:\\n$$\\\\boxed{x=1}$$\\n\\nj) Subtract $1$ from both sides:\\n$$x=1$$\\n\\nSo, the final answer is $x=1$, which aligns with option (D).\\n\\nThus, the correct choice is **D**.\"}\n",

Think step-by-step carefully.\\nuser\\nQ: If $\\\\frac{x-1}{3}=k$ and $k=3$, what is the value of $x ?$ Answer Choices: (A)2 (B)4 (C)9 (D)10\\nA: Among A through D, the answer is\\n<think>\\nOkay, so I need to solve this equation where x over something equals k, and then when k is 3, find x. Let me start by writing down the problem again to make sure I have it right. The equation is (x - 1)/3 = k, and they tell us that k = 3. Then we need to find the value of x from the options given: A) 2, B)4, C)9, D)10.\\n\\nAlright, let's break this down step by step. First, the original equation is (x - 1) divided by 3 equals k. So if I substitute k with 3, the equation becomes (x - 1)/3 = 3. Now, my goal is to solve for x here. \\n\\nTo isolate x, I should first get rid of the denominator 3. In algebra, when you have a fraction like this, you can multiply both sides by the same number to eliminate the denominator. So multiplying both sides by 3 would cancel out the division by 3 on the left side. Let me write that down:\\n\\nMultiply both sides by 3:\\n(x - 1)/3 * 3 = 3 * 3\\n\\nSimplifying the left side, the 3s cancel out, leaving just (x - 1). On the right side, 3 times 3 is 9. So now the equation is x - 1 = 9.\\n\\nNow, to solve for x, I need to get rid of the -1 in the left side. To do that, I can add 1 to both sides of the equation. That way, I keep the equation balanced. Let me do that:\\n\\nAdd 1 to both sides:\\nx - 1 + 1 = 9 + 1\\n\\nSimplifying both sides, the left side becomes x because -1 + 1 cancels out, and the right side is 10. So x = 10.\\n\\nLooking at the answer choices, D is 10. So the answer must be D.\\n\\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Sometimes even simple steps can have errors. Let's verify by plugging x = 10 back into the original equation to see if it works.\\n\\nOriginal equation: (x - 1)/3 = k. Substitute x with 10:\\n(10 - 1)/3 = 9/3 = 3. And since k is given as 3, that checks out. So yes, x = 10 satisfies the equation. Therefore, the correct answer is D)10.\\n\\nBut wait, why are the other answer choices there? Maybe someone could miscalculate. For example, if someone forgot to multiply both sides properly or messed up the addition. Let me check each option just to be thorough.\\n\\nOption A: 2. Plugging in x=2 gives (2 -1)/3 = 1/3 \\u2248 0.333, which is not 3. So A is wrong.\\n\\nOption B:4. Plugging in x=4 gives (4 -1)/3 = 3/3 = 1. Not 3. So B is incorrect.\\n\\nOption C:9. Plugging in x=9 gives (9 -1)/3 = 8/3 \\u2248 2.666..., which is not 3. So C is wrong.\\n\\nOption D:10. As checked earlier, gives 9/3 = 3, which matches k=3. So D is indeed correct.\\n\\nTherefore, after careful consideration and verification, the answer is D)10.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\n\\\\boxed{D}\\n</think>\\n\\nGiven the equation \\\\(\\\\frac{x-1}{3} = k\\\\) and \\\\(k = 3\\\\), we need to find the value of \\\\(x\\\\).\\n\\nFirst, substitute \\\\(k\\\\) with 3 in the equation:\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\frac{x-1}{3} = 3\\n\\\\]\\n\\nNext, multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to isolate \\\\(x - 1\\\\):\\n\\\\[\\nx - 1 = 3 \\\\times 3\\n\\\\]\\n\\\\[\\nx - 1 = 9\\n\\\\]\\n\\nThen, add 1 to both sides to solve for \\\\(x\\\\):\\n\\\\[\\nx = 9 + 1\\n\\\\]\\n\\\\[\\nx = 10\\n\\\\]\\n\\nVerification by substituting \\\\(x = 10\\\\) back into the original equation confirms the solution is correct.

The number of phones that she has left to fix at the end of each day can be estimated with the equation $P=108-23 d$, where $P$ is the number of phones left and $d$ is the number of days she has worked that week.

(D)Kathy repairs phones at a rate of 108 per day.\\nA: Among A through D, the answer is\\nuser\\nThe options given do not cover all possible meanings of the value 108 in this equation. Therefore, we cannot choose option C.\\nTherefore, the correct choice is (A).\\nI am not sure about the other answers. Please explain them.\\nAnswer: (A)\\nLet's think step by step:\\nGiven equation: P = 108 - 23d\\nWe know that P represents the number of phones left after d days.\\nTo find out what P means, we need to substitute values for d into the equation.\\nIf d = 1, then P = 108 - 23*1 = 85\\nor P = 108 - 23*2 = 79\\nor P = 108 - 23*3 = 68\\nor P = 108 - 23*4 = 55\\nor P = 108 - 23*5 = 42\\nor P = 108 - 23*6 = 27\\nor P = 108 - 23*7 = 0\\nFrom these values, it's clear that P = 108 when d = 1, or P = 108/2 = 54 when d = 2, or P = 108/3 = 34 when d = 3, etc.\\nSo, it seems that P = 108 always remains unchanged regardless of how many days Kathy works.\\nThis makes option (A) the correct answer.\\nThe correct answer is B.
